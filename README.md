# Friend-Finder
Looking to meet new people? Answer a handful of questions and let Friend Finder find the most compatible match for you.

## Features
  * The user answers a short, 10-question survey, and FriendFinder returns the name and photo of the person in the FriendFinder roster that best matches the user's input.
  * The web application receives input from a web interface and returns information from a server, using Node.js and Express.js.
  * Uses GET and POST methods.
  * An API is provided with each user's name, a link to a photo and the scores for each answer.
  * Completely mobile responsive.
  * Could easily be expanded with a MySQL to have a robust database.
